# Wavelet Tree — C++ Implementation

A clean, interactive C++ implementation of the **Wavelet Tree**, one of the most elegant succinct data structures in modern algorithm design. This project ships with a fully functional CLI demo that lets you explore `access`, `rank`, and `select` queries in real time.

## What is a Wavelet Tree?

> *"A wavelet tree is a slight generalization of an old (1988) data structure by Chazelle, heavily used in Computational Geometry... since 2003, these views of wavelet trees, and their interactions, have been fruitful in a surprisingly wide range of problems."*  
> — *Navarro, "Wavelet Trees for All" (2012, §1)*

The **wavelet tree** was invented in **2003 by Grossi, Gupta, and Vitter** as a space-efficient data structure to represent a sequence and answer powerful queries on it. It generalizes the classic `rank` and `select` operations—traditionally defined only on bitvectors—to **arbitrary alphabets**.

### How it works (intuition)

1. Take a sequence `S[1…n]` over an alphabet `Σ` of size `σ`.
2. At the root, partition the alphabet into two halves (e.g., low vs. high symbols).
3. Store a **bitmap** that tells whether each symbol in `S` belongs to the left or right half.
4. Recursively build the same structure for the two subsequences.
5. The result is a balanced binary tree of height `⌈log₂ σ⌉`.

> *Only the bitmaps and tree topology are stored.* The subsequences themselves are **not** stored—they can be reconstructed on the fly by tracking bits down the tree.

The name derives from an analogy with the **wavelet transform** for signals: just as wavelet transforms recursively decompose a signal into low-frequency and high-frequency components, the wavelet tree recursively decomposes a sequence into low-symbol and high-symbol partitions.

## Why Wavelet Trees Are Special

### 1. Succinct Space
A balanced wavelet tree stores the sequence in **n·⌈log₂ σ⌉ + o(n·log σ)** bits—essentially the same asymptotic space as a plain array, but with **rich query support** built in. With entropy coding (e.g., Huffman-shaped trees), the space drops to **n·H₀(S) + o(n)** bits, where `H₀(S)` is the zero-order empirical entropy of the string. This means the tree **compresses** the data while preserving full random access.

> *"Even using plain bitmap representations, giving the wavelet tree a Huffman shape leads to a much faster implementation in practice while compressing the data."*  
> — *Navarro (2012, §3.2)*

### 2. Three Powerful Views
The same structure can be interpreted as:
- **A sequence** — supports `access(i)`, `rank(c, i)`, `select(c, k)`.
- **A reordering / permutation** — tracks where each element moves after sorting by symbol.
- **A grid of points** — enables 2D range counting and reporting in `O(log n)` time per query.

> *"These views of wavelet trees, and their interactions, have been fruitful in a surprisingly wide range of problems, extending well beyond the areas of text indexing and computational geometry where the structure was conceived."*  
> — *Navarro (2012, §1)*

### 3. Rank & Select in O(log σ) Time
On a balanced tree, all three core operations run in **O(log σ)** time. For byte alphabets (σ = 256), this is practically **O(1)**—at most 8 bitmap levels to traverse.

### 4. Entropy & High-Order Compression
The wavelet tree adapts naturally to data compressibility:
- **Zero-order entropy:** Using entropy-coded bitmaps (e.g., Raman et al.’s fully indexable dictionaries), total space becomes **n·H₀(S) + o(n)** bits.
- **High-order entropy:** Building the tree on the Burrows–Wheeler transform achieves **n·Hₖ(S) + o(n·log σ)** bits simultaneously for any `k ≤ α·logσ n`.

> *"Using a proper encoding on its bitmaps, a wavelet tree on the whole Burrows–Wheeler transform can reach k-th order entropy compression of a string."*  
> — *Navarro (2012, §3.3)*

### 5. Extensions & Modern Variants
- **Multi-ary wavelet trees** reduce height to `O(log_d σ)`.
- **Wavelet matrices** flatten the tree into a single bitmap per level for pointerless navigation.
- **Dynamic wavelet trees** support insertions and deletions, enabling dynamic FM-indexes.
- **Wavelet tries** extend the structure to sequences of strings.

> *"The data structure can be made dynamic, supporting insertions and deletions at arbitrary points of the string; this feature enables the implementation of dynamic FM-indexes."*  
> — *Wikipedia, "Wavelet Tree"*

## Applications

Wavelet trees have found use in an astonishingly diverse set of domains:

| Domain | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Text Indexing** | Compressed suffix arrays, FM-indexes, full-text search |
| **Bioinformatics** | DNA sequence analysis, short-read mapping, BWT-based indexes |
| **Computational Geometry** | 2D range counting / reporting, orthogonal range queries |
| **String Algorithms** | Range quantile, range mode, top-k in substrings |
| **Information Retrieval** | Document listing, term proximity queries, inverted indexes |
| **Data Compression** | Entropy-bound representation with direct random access |
| **Database Systems** | Succinct column stores, range histograms, indexable compression |

## Working Demo

This repository includes an **interactive command-line tool** (`src/wavelet_tree.cpp`) that lets you build a wavelet tree over any string and query it live.

### Build & Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hemachandran-1206/wavelet-tree.git
cd wavelet-tree

# Compile
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -o wavelet_tree src/wavelet_tree.cpp

# Run the interactive demo
./wavelet_tree
```

### Example Session

```
=== Wavelet Tree (string) interactive tool ===

Enter your string now:
abracadabra

Wavelet Tree built for string of length 11.
Type 'help' to see commands again.

> access 0
character at index 0 : 'a'
> access 3
character at index 3 : 'a'
> rank a 10
rank('a', 10) = 5
> select a 3
select('a', 3) = 5
> rank b 10
rank('b', 10) = 2
> select b 2
select('b', 2) = 8
> exit
Goodbye!
```

### Supported Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `access i` | Returns the character at **0-based** index `i` |
| `rank c p` | Returns number of occurrences of character `c` in `s[0..p]` (inclusive, 0-based) |
| `select c k` | Returns the **0-based** index of the `k`-th occurrence of `c` (`k` is 1-based) |
| `help` | Show command reference |
| `exit` | Quit the program |

## Algorithm & Complexity

| Operation | Time | Space (balanced) |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| Build | `O(n log σ)` | `n·⌈log σ⌉ + o(n·log σ)` bits |
| `access(i)` | `O(log σ)` | — |
| `rank(c, i)` | `O(log σ)` | — |
| `select(c, k)` | `O(log σ)` | — |

For a **byte alphabet** (σ = 256), all operations traverse at most **8 levels**—effectively constant time in practice.

### Implementation Details

- **Bitmaps:** Each node stores a `vector<int>` of bits and prefix sums (`pref`), enabling `rank₁` and `rank₀` in **O(1)** time per level.
- **Select support:** `zeros` and `ones` vectors store the positions of each bit value, allowing `select₀` and `select₁` in **O(1)**.
- **Recursion:** The tree is built recursively by partitioning the current alphabet range and filtering the subsequence into left/right children.
- **Memory model:** Each node owns its bitmaps and child pointers; the tree is fully deallocatable via standard `delete` ( RAII extension is straightforward).
